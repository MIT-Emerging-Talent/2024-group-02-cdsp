# Introduction
Date: 5-16 February

This milestone focuses on analyzing the collected data to extract useful and meaningful insights for this project.

# Achievements

1. We explored several information sources to acquire datasets on recent IT industry layoffs. We collected and cleaned multiple datasets, then combined them into a single, usable dataset for our analysis. We updated our GitHub repository with a revised ReadMe file that provides a more detailed explanation of our project.

2. We used Jupyter Notebook to analyze the created dataset and generate visualizations that present information such as layoff percentages, geographical distribution of layoffs, and industry breakdown of layoffs.

# In Process

Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract further insights about tech layoffs from the dataset.

# Challenge 

1. Obtaining a dataset containing specific tech positions or careers and their corresponding layoff numbers proved challenging.
2. Similarly, we encountered difficulty in finding a dataset that provided layoff numbers categorized by gender.

# Tools and Techniques

 We have used the Python programming language for data scraping, cleaning, and analysis, leveraging libraries such as 
 Pandas
 NumPy
 Matplotlib
 Google Colab
 Jupyter Notebook.

 # Conclusion

 Our analysis of the tech layoff dataset from Layoffs.fyi revealed that the finance industry has experienced a high number of layoffs within the tech sector. Additionally, the San Francisco Bay Area has been significantly impacted by tech layoffs.
