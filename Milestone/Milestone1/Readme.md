# Problem Identification
This was the first milestone in the project where team members brainstormed several problems that could be solved by data science practices. Technically, to complete this milestone which started on January 22nd to January 26th, it started by:

* Divergent thinking: Brainstorming a wide range of ideas and possible problems that the communities are facing.
