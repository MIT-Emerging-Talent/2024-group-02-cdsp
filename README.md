## Project Idea: Trending Layoffs in the IT Sector

## Domain: IT Sector

### Problem Statement

In recent times, the IT sector has undergone a notable transformation in hiring practices, influenced by multiple factors. We hypothesize that this shift is primarily due to three key factors: economic trends and inflation, the advent of new technological tools, and the alignment of IT companies' growth trajectories with contemporary trends. These elements have collectively led to a more stringent hiring process. Moreover, the IT industry experienced significant layoffs in 2023, with approximately 200,000+ personnel affected during a major layoff period. This development necessitates a thorough analysis of the sector's future prospects.

### Current Research Objective

Our team is interested in exploring the future prospects for individuals seeking a career in the IT sector, the potential disadvantages awaiting them, and the possible paths to success based on available data.

### Constraints

A major challenge in this study is the lack of specific layoff numbers for each company, as well as difficulty in obtaining detailed information about different industry sectors and their employees. To address these issues, we plan to group companies by location and use substitute data when precise information is unavailable. Our main goal is not to ascertain exact numbers for every company but to obtain a broad view of the industry as a whole, enabling us to understand the patterns and connections within these trends.

### Stakeholder or Target Audience

This research is especially relevant to our cohort and the students at MIT Emerging Talent who are likely to seek employment in the IT field. Given the increasing reliance on technology and remote work, IT skills have become nearly indispensable. However, the IT sector is vast and continuously branching into numerous subfields.

### Data Modeling Strategy


## A Multi-Variable Analysis Approach

### Objectives:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and insights related to tech layoffs.
- Identify potential factors contributing to tech layoffs and their effects on the industry.
- Explore temporal, geographic, and industry-specific trends in tech layoffs.
- Investigate correlations between company characteristics (e.g., stage, funding) and layoff likelihood.
- Assess the scale and impact of tech layoffs in terms of affected employees and industries.

### Dimensions of Analysis:
- **Trend Over Time:** Understand how tech layoffs have evolved over time.
- **Geographic Distribution:** Analyze the locations of companies conducting layoffs.
- **Impact by Industry:** Identify the tech sectors most affected by layoffs.
- **Company Stage and Financial Health:** Investigate how a company's stage and funding relate to layoff likelihood.
- **Scale of Layoffs:** Assess the magnitude of layoffs in terms of affected employees.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore if layoff timing correlates with specific geographic locations.

Using the above mentioned various perspectives we'll be examining and analyzing our data on tech layoffs.
