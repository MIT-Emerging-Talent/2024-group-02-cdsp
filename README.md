## Problem statement:
In recent times, there has been a notable transformation in the hiring practices within the IT sector.
There are multiple factors that impact this shift.
We assume that this shift is primarily influenced by three key factors: 
economic trends and inflation, the advent of new technological tools, and the growth trajectory of IT companies aligned with contemporary trends. 
These elements collectively contribute to a more stringent hiring process. 
Furthermore, the IT industry experienced significant layoffs in 2023, with approximately 200,000+ personnel affected during a major layoff period.
This development necessitates a thorough analysis of the sector's future prospects. 

## Current Research Objective:
As a team we are interested in exploring what are the future prospects for the people seeking a career in the IT sector, 
the disadvantages waiting for them, and the possible success paths based on the data available.

## Constraints:
A big hurdle we're facing in this study is the lack of specific layoff numbers for each company. 
It's also hard to get detailed info about different industry sectors and their employees. 
To work around these issues, we can group companies by where they're located and use substitute data when we can't find exactly what we need. 
Our main goal isn't to chase down precise numbers for every company. Rather, we want to get a big-picture view of what's happening in the industry as a whole.
This way, we can better understand the patterns and connections in these trends.

## Stakeholder or Target Audience:
We believe that exploring this topic is a crucial research question, especially for our cohort and students at MIT Emerging Talent who are likely to seek employment in the IT field.
With the increasing reliance on technology and remote work, IT skills have become nearly indispensable. 
However, the IT sector is not only vast but also continuously expanding into numerous subfields.
